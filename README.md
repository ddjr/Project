# Project_Euler_1-Multiples-of-3-and-5

This Project was done as part of https://projecteuler.net/ problem sets. This code solves problem 1. The following discription is taken from https://projecteuler.net/problem=1:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

To run the project open your terminal, find the directory where this file is located, and type python total_of_multiples_of_3_and_5.py
